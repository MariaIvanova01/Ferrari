# Ferrari

Model an application that contains a class Ferrari and an interface. Your task is simple, you have a car - Ferrari, its model is "488-Spider" and it has a driver.

Your Ferrari should have the functionality to use brakes and push the gas pedal.

When the brakes are pushed down print "Brakes!", and when the gas pedal is pushed down - "brum-brum-brum-brrrrr". As you may have guessed this functionality is typical for all cars, so you should implement an interface to describe it.

Your task is to create a Ferrari and set the driver's name to the passed one in the input. After that, print the info. Take a look at the Examples to understand the task better.

Output
----------------------

On the single output line, print the model, the messages from the brakes and gas pedal methods, and the driver's name. In the following format:

"{model}/{brakes}/{gas}/{driver's name}"
